To open run the website, copy the link https://kkelvin-li.github.io/Codeword2024/SKO/SKO.html , and below are my reflection. I have the same content in the sko website as well, this is just more structured version.

This studio has been an eye-opener in terms of refining my approach to coding and design, emphasising clarity, adaptability, and strategic thinking. A primary takeaway is the importance of precision in coding. Through the "Draw and Guess" activity, I learned how even small ambiguities can lead to major misunderstandings. When others struggled to interpret my pseudocode, I realised that coding requires clear, explicit instructions, not just for machines but for anyone who might interact with or build upon my code. This experience has led me to incorporate detailed comments and make my commands as specific as possible, particularly when working with shape positioning in HTML and p5.js.
Feedback sessions with my peers also underscored the value of openness to suggestions, even if I don’t directly implement them. For example, a recommendation to explore chaotic systems like the three-body problem broadened my perspective on my pendulum project, even though I ultimately found it too complex to pursue. This feedback taught me that even indirect suggestions can inspire new ways of thinking, and understanding the reasoning behind them often brings valuable insights that go beyond immediate implementation.

I also learned the importance of focusing on the overall structure before getting caught up in details. Previously, I would dive into refining font sizes or aligning elements early on, which often led to wasted time. Now, I concentrate on establishing a clear framework—defining the content layout, setting up main interactions, and ensuring functional flow—before perfecting small design details. This shift has saved me a lot of time and reduced the stress of last-minute fixes, allowing me to build a solid base to refine rather than repeatedly adjusting incomplete work.

The Crazy Eights activity taught me to generate ideas quickly and helped me break out of conventional thinking. By forcing associations—like designing a website layout with a roller coaster in mind—I pushed myself to think more creatively under pressure. This exercise in rapid idea generation showed me how time constraints can drive innovation and how useful unconventional associations can be for sparking fresh solutions.
When it comes to tools, I now better understand the distinct roles of HTML and p5.js. I see HTML as the structural foundation, ideal for organising content, while p5.js is a powerful tool for creating dynamic visuals and animations. Treating each tool for its strengths has streamlined my workflow, helping me achieve better results without overloading one tool.

Lastly, testing has become a critical part of my process. Working across platforms—such as GitHub, p5.js, and Visual Studio Code—revealed inconsistencies, especially when switching between operating systems. This has taught me the importance of cross-platform testing to ensure consistency and usability, regardless of where or how the project is viewed.

In sum, this project has deepened my understanding of clarity in coding, strategic structuring, tool selection, rapid ideation, and rigorous testing. These lessons have been instrumental in shaping a more efficient and adaptable workflow that I’ll carry into future design projects.
